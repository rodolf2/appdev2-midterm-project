# appdev2-midterm-project

This project is a simple RESTful API server built using Node.js. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a list of todo items stored in a local todos.json file, without using any external database or framework like Express. A custom logging system using Nodeâ€™s events module logs all API requests to a file named logs.txt, including timestamps and request details.
